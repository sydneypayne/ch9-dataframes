# Exercise 1: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in the first 4 games of their season
# Hint: (google "Seahawks scores")
points <- c(48,20,26,17)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have allowed to be scored against them in the first 4 games
allowed <- c(17,13,13,13)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
scores <- data.frame(points, allowed)
View(scores)
# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points
diff <- points - allowed
scores <- data.frame(points,allowed,diff)
View(scores)
# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom
won <- points > allowed
scores <- data.frame(points, allowed, diff, won)
View(scores)
# Create a vector of the opponents
opponents <- c("Chargers", "Vikings", "Chiefs", "Raiders")

# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
rownames(scores) <- opponents
View(scores)
